## Getting Started

To start the development server, run the following command:

```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. You can start making changes to the code, and the browser will hot-reload to reflect your changes instantly.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready build of your app in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy this build to a hosting service of your choice.

## Folder Structure

- `src`: Contains the source code of the React app.
- `public`: Contains public assets like HTML files, images, etc.
